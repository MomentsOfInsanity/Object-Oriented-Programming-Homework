Static Methods, Static Variables and Object Bags

1. Write two static methods in a Utilities class. One will convert temperature from Celsius to
Fahrenheit and one will convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

2. Write a Course class that contains the following instance variables:
a. courseName: String
b. numberOfCredits: int
c. letterGrade: String
Create a Helper class that contains a static calculateGPA method.
Finally, create a Demo class in which you will hard code a bunch of courses and display the GPA
based on these courses by calling the calculateGPA method.

3. Create a super class called Person. The class should contain the following instance variables:
a. name: String
b. id: String
The id has to be unique and incremented automatically for each instance of the Person class
Create a Student class and a Faculty class that extend the Person class. The Student class has a
field called gpa and the Faculty class has a field called salary, and both fields are of the double
type.
Create a PersonBag class that contains a Person array of a given maximum size that is capable of
storing a bunch of Student and Faculty objects. Also, write the following methods in the class
using the following headers:
a. public void insertPerson(Person person)
b. public Person findPersonById(String id)
c. public Pereson findPersonByName(String name)
d. public Student findStudentById(String id)
e. public Student findStudentByName(String name)
f. public Person deletePersonById(String id)
g. public Student deleteStudentByid(String id)
Finally in the Demo class, create a PersonBag object and insert a bunch of Student and Faculty
objects in the array. You may hard code these objects. Then demonstrate how all the methods
work.
